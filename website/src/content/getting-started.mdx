## Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository
- An API key from one of the supported LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google)

## Step 1: Add the Review Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/argus-review.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: Argus PR Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: sudzxd/argus@develop
        with:
          model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

## Step 2: Add Your API Key

Go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** in your repository and add your LLM provider's API key:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude models
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` for GPT models
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for Gemini models

## Step 3: Bootstrap the Index (Optional)

For the best review quality, bootstrap the codebase index before your first review. Add this workflow or run it manually:

```yaml
name: Argus Index
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      mode:
        description: "bootstrap or index"
        default: "bootstrap"

jobs:
  index:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - uses: sudzxd/argus@develop
        with:
          mode: ${{ inputs.mode }}
          model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

Trigger it once with `mode: bootstrap` to build the full codebase map. After that, incremental indexing runs automatically on every push.

## Step 4: Open a Pull Request

That's it. Open a PR and Argus will post inline review comments within a few minutes.
